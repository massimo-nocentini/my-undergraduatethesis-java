Why have SpeciesType and CompartmentType disappeared in Level 3? Image:New.gif

In reality, SpeciesType in SBML Level 2 was a construct intended to support the ability to define "generalized reactions", as well as multicompartment entities. The idea of generalized reactions is to allow easy definition of reactions that take place in different compartments but otherwise are identical; this is essentially the concept of rule-based reactions of a sort found in systems such as BioNetGen. However, while SpeciesTypes and CompartmentTypes were accepted for introduction in SBML Level 2, the SBML community rejected the introduction of generalized reactions. Thus, the primary purpose of the SpeciesType construct was never realized. Moreover, it also turned out that in the 4 years of the existence of SpeciesType and CompartmentType in Level 2, very little software support was developed for them. As a result of these considerations, during the development of SBML Level 3, it was decided that these constructs did not belong in Level 3 Core, and any such constructs should be moved instead to Level 3 packages. (Some discussion of the reasoning can be found on a separate page.)
I used SpeciesType to manage cross-references of similar entities—what do I do now? Image:New.gif

Some software systems use SpeciesType as it is intended in SBML Level 2, to represent the class or type of entities that may appear in multiple compartments in a model. Some of those software systems also annotate those types with references to database entries. It may appear that the apparent loss of SpeciesType in Level 3 is a going to be a problem for them. However, consider the following:

    SBML Level 2 is not dead. Not only are SBML Levels supposed to co-exist (as mentioned elsewhere in this FAQ), but software supporting Level 2 will continue for many years—after all, just because Level 3 has been introduced does not mean that software will suddently stop supporting Level 2. Software developers are much more likely to only add support for Level 3 while simultaneously maintaining support for Level 2. So models and tools can be fully expected to continue supporting Level 2 for the foreseeable future. If your modeling efforts need Level 2's SpeciesType construct, by all means, continue to read and write Level 2.
    SpeciesType are part of the Level 3 Multi package. They will, therefore, be available as soon as the package is finalized.
    Another upcoming Level 3 package, Groups, will provide a generalized grouping mechanism that should serve for lumping annotations and other information about similar entities in a model.
